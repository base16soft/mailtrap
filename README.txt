== DESCRIPTION:

Mailtrap is a mock SMTP server for use in Rails development. This package also includes Mailshovel, a mock POP3 server that works with Mailtrap. You can configure your mail client (eg Mail.App) to connect to Mailshovel, and then manage messages that ActionMailer has "sent" using its GUI.

Mailtrap waits on your chosen port for a client to connect and talks _just enough_ SMTP protocol for ActionMailer to successfully deliver its message.

Mailtrap makes *no* attempt to actually deliver messages and, instead, writes them into a series of files which are read by Mailshovel.

You can configure the hostname (default: localhost) and port (default: 2525) for the server and also where the messages get written (default: /var/tmp/mailtrap.log).
	
== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Lightweight, no setup
* Runs as a daemon with start, stop, etc..
* Tested with ActionMailer's SMTP delivery method
* Very, very, dumb ... might not work with an arbitrary SMTP client

== SYNOPSIS:

To use the defaults host:localhost, port:2525 and port:1100, file:/var/log/mailtrap.log

* mailtrap start

This will start both mailtrap and mailshovel.

Customise startup:

* sudo mailtrap start --host my.host --smtp_port 25 --pop3_port 110 --once --file=/var/log/messages.txt --msg_dir=/tmp/msgs
(sudo because you want to use restricted port 25)

For more info:

* mailtrap --help (to see Daemonization options)
* mailtrap start --help (to see Mailtrap options)

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Hoe rubygem
* Rubygems rubygem
* Daemons rubygem
* Trollop rubygem

All these are automatically installed if you use gem install -y

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install -y mailshovel
